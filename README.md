# Thamuz Skin Injector

This repository contains a Python script (`thamuz_skin_injector.py`) designed to inject custom skins for Thamuz in Mobile Legends.

## Important Note on Skin Files

**ChatMonkey cannot generate actual 3D models (.fbx), textures (.png), or particle effects (.pfx) from an image or description.** These are complex binary game assets that require specialized 3D modeling and game development tools to create.

This script generates *structural placeholder files* in the `NewThamuzSkin` directory. These are not real graphical assets but serve to demonstrate the expected file structure for the injector to function. **You MUST replace these placeholder files with actual, extracted Thamuz skin assets** that you obtain from the game's files or modding communities.

## Usage

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/johnderrickos12-pixel/ThamuzSkinInjector.git
    cd ThamuzSkinInjector
    ```

2.  **Acquire and Prepare your custom skin assets:**
    -   First, obtain the *actual* Thamuz skin files (e.g., `.fbx` model, `.png` textures like albedo and normal maps, and `.pfx` or similar effect files) that you wish to inject.
    -   Create a folder named `NewThamuzSkin` in the same directory as `thamuz_skin_injector.py`.
    -   Inside `NewThamuzSkin`, create three subdirectories: `Model`, `Texture`, and `FX`.
    -   Place your actual custom skin files into their respective folders, replacing the placeholders generated by the script.

    Example structure (after replacing placeholders with real files):
    ```
    ThamuzSkinInjector/
    ├── thamuz_skin_injector.py
    └── NewThamuzSkin/
        ├── Model/
        │   └── your_actual_thamuz_model.fbx  <-- YOUR REAL .FBX FILE
        ├── Texture/
        │   ├── your_actual_thamuz_albedo.png <-- YOUR REAL .PNG TEXTURE
        │   └── your_actual_thamuz_normal.png <-- YOUR REAL .PNG NORMAL MAP
        └── FX/
            └── your_actual_thamuz_skill_effect.pfx <-- YOUR REAL .PFX FILE
    ```

3.  **Run the injector script:**
    ```bash
    python thamuz_skin_injector.py
    ```
    The script will attempt to locate your Mobile Legends installation and copy the new skin files into the appropriate game directories.
    You may need to manually adjust the `get_game_installation_path()` function in `thamuz_skin_injector.py` if your specific game installation location is not automatically detected (especially for PC emulators or non-standard Android setups).

4.  **Restart Mobile Legends:**
    After the script completes, restart your Mobile Legends game to see the injected Thamuz skin.
